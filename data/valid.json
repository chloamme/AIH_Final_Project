The walls of the arteries also become stiffer and cannot widen (dilate) to allow greater blood flow when needed.   As a result, the muscles of your legs cannot get enough blood and oxygen when they are working harder (such as during exercise or walking). If PAD becomes severe, there may not be enough blood and oxygen, even when the muscles are resting.  Peripheral artery disease is a common disorder. It most often affects men over age 50, but women can have it as well. People are at higher risk if they have a history of:  - Abnormal cholesterol  - Diabetes  - Heart disease (coronary artery disease)  - High blood pressure (hypertension)  - Kidney disease involving hemodialysis  - Smoking  - Stroke (cerebrovascular disease))"
