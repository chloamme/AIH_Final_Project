A doctor can help you determine the cause of your swallowing problem and develop a treatment plan.\\n\\nWhat are the most common swallowing problems ?\\n\\nThe most common swallowing problems are:\\n\\n* aspiration (food or liquid goes into the lungs)\\n* aspiration pneumonia (food or liquid goes into the lungs)\\n* aspiration into the esophagus (food or liquid goes into the esophagus)\\n* aspiration into the stomach (food or liquid goes into the stomach)\\n* aspiration into the small intestine (food or liquid goes into the small intestine)\\n* aspiration into the liver (food or liquid goes into the liver)\\n* aspiration into the pancreas (food or liquid goes into the pancreas)\\n* aspiration into the kidneys (food or liquid goes into the kidneys)\\n* aspiration into the bowels (food or liquid goes into the bowels)\\n* aspiration into the bladder (food or liquid goes into the bladder)\\n* aspiration into the kidneys (food or liquid goes into the kidneys)\\n* aspiration into the small intestine (food or liquid goes into the small intestine)\\n* aspiration into the stomach (food or liquid goes into the stomach)\\n* aspiration', 'Do you have information about Eye Wear?\\n\\nI have information about eye wear. I can tell you about the different types of eye wear, such as sunglasses, contact lenses, and prescription glasses. I can also tell you about the different brands and styles of eye wear.\\n\\nWhat is your question about eye wear?', 'Do you have information about Native American Health and Well-being?', \"Where to find support for people with Marfan syndrome ?\\n\\nMarfan syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects connective tissue. It can cause a range of symptoms, including heart problems, vision problems, and joint problems.\\n\\nIf you're looking for support for people with Marfan syndrome, there are several organizations and resources that can provide you with information and connections. Here are a few:\\n\\n1. The Marfan Foundation: This organization provides resources and support for people living with Marfan syndrome. They offer a range of services, including education, advocacy, and support groups.\\n\\n2. The Marfan Syndrome Association: This organization provides resources and support for people living with Marfan syndrome. They offer a range of services, including education, advocacy, and support groups.\\n\\n3. The National Marfan Foundation: This organization provides resources and support for people living with Marfan syndrome. They offer a range of services, including education, advocacy, and support groups.\\n\\n4. The American Marfan Foundation: This organization provides resources and support for people living with Marfan syndrome. They offer a range of services, including education, advocacy, and support groups.\\n\\n5. The Marfan Syndrome Association of America: This organization provides resources and support for people living with Marfan syndrome. They offer a range of services,\", 'What causes Bleeding gums ?\\n\\nBleeding gums is a common problem that affects many people. It is caused by a number of factors.\\n\\nOne of the main causes of bleeding gums is poor oral hygiene. This means that you do not brush your teeth regularly and do not floss properly.\\n\\nPoor oral hygiene can lead to the growth of bacteria in your mouth. These bacteria can cause inflammation and infection in your gums.\\n\\nAnother cause of bleeding gums is gum disease. This is a serious condition that can lead to tooth loss. Gum disease is caused by the buildup of plaque and tartar on your teeth.\\n\\nPlaque is a sticky film of bacteria that forms on your teeth. It can cause inflammation and infection in your gums. Tartar is a hard, sticky deposit that forms on your teeth. It can cause gum disease and lead to bleeding gums.\\n\\nSmoking is another major cause of bleeding gums. Smoking can damage your gums and lead to gum disease.\\n\\nPoor nutrition is also a cause of bleeding gums. If you do not get enough nutrients, your body may not be able to fight off infections and bacteria.\\n\\nStress is another factor that can cause bleeding gums. Stress can weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to gum disease.\\n\\nB']\n"

This is because the brain does not send signals to the breathing muscles.  Central sleep apnea is a common condition. It is more common in older people.  Central sleep apnea is often confused with sleep apnea due to airway obstruction. However, the main difference is that people with central sleep apnea have a problem with the brain's control of breathing, whereas people with sleep apnea due to airway obstruction have a problem with the airway.)\"\n",
