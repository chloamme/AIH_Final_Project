Prescription drugs can be bought without a prescription. Some people take them without a prescription for a long time.  Some prescription drugs can be abused. Abusing them can lead to addiction.  Addicted people may take the drugs even though they cause harm. They may also take the drugs to get high.  The drugs can also cause side effects. These can be serious. They may include:  - Headaches  - Dizziness  - Fatigue  - Nausea  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal cramps  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal swelling  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  - Abdominal pain  -']\n"
